# OMDB MVVM

OMDB MVVM is an iOS app that uses the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to search for movies and TV shows. It is built using the [Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–viewmodel) architectural pattern and makes use of the [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) and [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) libraries for networking and image loading. The app also uses [Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata) for local data persistence.
